Description: Tools and code supporting two core NNHIP data workflows: 
  (1) ingestion, validation and transformation of monthly aggregate submissions
  for Place-level scorecards, and (2) secure linkage of survey data with UDAL 
  datasets to support the production of de-identified, patient-level dashboards.
